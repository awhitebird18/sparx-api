  "Hey, did you know the internet was actually developed way back in the 1960s? It's not as modern as we think!",
  'Really? I always thought it was a 90s thing, with the whole dot-com boom.',
  'Nah, it started as a way for government and research institutions to communicate on a network called ARPANET. Pretty cool, huh?',
  "That's wild! So, when did it become something everyone could use?",
  "I think it was around the early 90s when the World Wide Web was invented. That's what really kicked things off for public use.",
  'Oh, right! The Web is actually just a part of the internet, isnt it? Its what we use to access websites through browsers.',
  'Exactly! And every website has this unique address called a URL, which stands for Uniform Resource Locator.',
  'Ive heard about IP addresses too. Those are like the internets way of finding computers, right?',
  "Yep! Every device connected to the internet has an IP address. It's like the postal system but for digital information.",
  "It's fascinating how it's all interconnected. I read that there are undersea cables connecting the internet across continents!",

export const http = [
  "So, I was reading up on how websites work and kept seeing 'HTTP' everywhere. What is it exactly?",
  "HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol. It's the foundation of any data exchange on the Web and it's what browsers use to load web pages.",
  'Oh, so is that why most website addresses start with http:// or https://?',
  "Exactly! The 's' in https:// stands for 'secure'. It means all communications between your browser and the website are encrypted.",
  'I see. So, HTTP is like a set of rules for how information is shared and displayed on the internet?',
  "Right. It defines a method for requesting and transmitting web pages and other content. It's like asking for a page in a specific way that a server can understand.",
  'How does it actually work, though? Like, what happens when I click on a link?',
  'When you click a link, your browser sends an HTTP request to the server where the website is hosted. The server then responds with the requested page, which your browser displays.',
  'That sounds like it happens really fast!',
  "It does! And every time you submit a form, or even search on Google, you're making HTTP requests. The speed and reliability of HTTP are what make the Web so usable.",
